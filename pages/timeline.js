        Yoga really had an impact on my life. A groundbreaking impact that changed so much and helped me become a better version of myself (as clich√© as this might sound in 2021).
        The following is a place where you can explore the world of shift_happens_yoga, take a deep dive into what brought me here or just follow along on this indeed life changing endeavour.
        There is also <Link href="/map"><a>the Map</a></Link> where you can visually interact with all the shifting events of my journey.
        As one of my best teachers always used to say:
      </p>
      <Quote text="Make your breath louder than your thoughts" classes='mt-4 mb-16' />
      <Timeline />
      <Video />
    </div>

  return (
    <Layout>
      {page}
    </Layout>

export default Yoga
